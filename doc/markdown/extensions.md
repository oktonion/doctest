## Extensions

The doctest header doesn't include any external or stdlib headers in it's interface part in order to provide the most optimal build times but that means it is limited in what it can provide as functionality => that's when extensions come into play. They are located as header files in [`doctest/extensions`](../../doctest/extensions) and each of them is documented in a section here.
